# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- use immutable instances for web server
- use image hardening (latest OS, fully patched, etc)
- use cloudformation templates inspection tools like CFRipper

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
As I've mentioned in "E1T5.txt", yes, that would further increase the security of the bucket making it inaccessible from the internet

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Apparently, no, when I applied the encryption I was informed that only new files would inherit the encryption settings

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
I tried it and got "An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the UpdateStack operation: No updates are to be performed". So apparently, it does nothing, however we may fall into the failed state if we make too many modifications.
